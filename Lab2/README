Background
As discussed in lab 1, for this class we’ll be using a command-line based flow to write C code for our development board. For this assignment, you’ll be writing and compiling some C code using this technique. Specifically, you’ll be creating your C program in the text or code editor of your choice, then you’ll construct and assemble a Makefile to compile your program with the gcc compiler.

Assignment
Your task for this lab is to install the opencv library on your Linux computing environment, then write a C/C++ image viewer. Your program should run from the command line, taking the filename of an image as a command line argument, and should display that image to the user. You should build your C/C++ program using a makefile and the gcc (or g++) compiler.
