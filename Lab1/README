Background
For this class, we will be learning high-performance programming in the context of the Linux Operating System and POSIX threading (pthreads) frameworks. While a myriad of development environments and threading libraries exist, Linux+pthreads is one of the most commonly used combinations for everything from embedded devices to enterprise grade data centers.

Many SDKs exist to assist in software development (Eclipse, Netbeans, Code Composer Studio, etc.), however, many programmers still rely on a command-line/script-based flow to create and test software. This is the technique we will be using in this class.

Overview
The purpose of this lab is to get you acquainted with the Linux command prompt. You’ll be learning in the form of a command-line based game that will require you to use advanced command-line techniques to solve puzzles!Essentially, this is a capture the flag game. The instructions below will get you logged into a VM as user “level0”. From there, you’ll need to find a filethat contains a flag{<username for next level>:<passwordforusername for next level>}.Once you’ve found the flag, use the username and password to ssh into the next level!
